  "Be Water, My Friend.
  Empty your mind.
  Be formless, shapeless, like water.
  You put water into a cup, it becomes the cup.
  You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.
  You put it into a teapot, it becomes the teapot.
  Now water can flow or it can crash.
  Be water, my friend."

                                                                                  
                                                                                    -- Bruce Lee
